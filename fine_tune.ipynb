IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEDERAL LAND MANAGERS AND GATEWAY \\n              COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT COMPATIBLE LAND MANAGEMENT OF BOTH \\n              FEDERAL AND ADJACENT LANDS.\\n\\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Communities that are adjacent to or near Federal lands, \\n        including units of the National Park System, units of the \\n        National Wildlife Refuge System, units of the National Forest \\n        System, and lands administered by the Bureau of Land \\n        Management, are vitally impacted by the management and public \\n        use of these Federal lands.\\n            (2) These communities, commonly known as gateway \\n        communities, fulfill an integral part in the mission of the \\n        Federal lands by providing necessary services, such as schools, \\n        roads, search and rescue, emergency, medical, provisioning, \\n        logistical support, living quarters, and drinking water and \\n        sanitary systems, for both visitors to the Federal lands and \\n        employees of Federal land management agencies.\\n            (3) Provision of these vital services by gateway \\n        communities is an essential ingredient for a meaningful and \\n        enjoyable experience by visitors to the Federal lands because \\n        Federal land management agencies are unable to provide, or are \\n        prevented from providing, these services.\\n            (4) Gateway communities serve as an entry point for persons \\n        who visit the Federal lands and are ideal for establishment of \\n        visitor services, including lodging, food service, fuel and \\n        auto repairs, emergency services, and visitor information.\\n            (5) Development in these gateway communities affect the \\n        management and protection of these Federal lands, depending on \\n        the extent to which advance planning for the local development \\n        is coordinated between the communities and Federal land \\n        managers.\\n            (6) The planning and management decisions of Federal land \\n        managers can have unintended consequences for gateway \\n        communities and the Federal lands, when the decisions are not \\n        adequately communicated to, or coordinated with, the elected \\n        officials and residents of gateway communities.\\n            (7) Experts in land management planning are available to \\n        Federal land managers, but persons with technical planning \\n        skills are often not readily available to gateway communities, \\n        particularly small gateway communities.\\n            (8) Gateway communities are often affected by the policies \\n        and actions of several Federal land agencies and both the \\n        communities and the agencies would benefit from greater \\n        interagency coordination of those policies and actions.\\n            (9) Persuading gateway communities to make decisions and \\n        undertake actions in their communities that would also be in \\n        the best interest of the Federal lands is most likely to occur \\n        when such decisionmaking and actions are built upon a \\n        foundation of cooperation and coordination.\\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to require Federal land \\nmanagers to communicate, coordinate, and cooperate with gateway \\ncommunities in order to--\\n            (1) improve the relationships among Federal land managers, \\n        elected officials, and residents of gateway communities;\\n            (2) enhance the facilities and services in gateway \\n        communities available to visitors to Federal lands, when \\ncompatible with the management of these lands; and\\n            (3) result in better local land use planning and decisions \\n        by Federal land managers.\\n    (c) Definitions.--In this section:\\n            (1) Gateway community.--The term ``gateway community'' \\n        means a county, city, town, village, or other subdivision of a \\n        State, or a federally recognized American Indian tribe or \\n        Alaska Native village, that--\\n                    (A) is incorporated or recognized in a county or \\n                regional land use plan;

To facilitate \\n        such involvement, the Federal land agencies shall provide these \\n        officials, at the earliest possible time, with a summary in \\n        nontechnical language of the assumptions, purposes, goals, and \\n        objectives of such a plan, decision, project, or policy and a \\n        description of any anticipated significant impact of the plan, \\n        decision, or policy on gateway communities.\\n            (2) Early notice of proposed decisions.--To the extent \\n        practicable, the Federal land agencies shall provide local \\n        gateway communities with early public notice of proposed \\n        decisions of these agencies that may have a significant impact \\n        on gateway communities.\\n            (3) Training sessions.--The Federal land agencies shall \\n        offer training sessions for elected and appointed officials of \\n        gateway communities at which such officials can obtain a better \\n        understanding of--\\n                    (A) agency planning processes; and\\n                    (B) the methods by which they can participate most \\n                meaningfully in the development of the agency plans, \\n                decisions, and policies referred to in paragraph (1).\\n            (4) Technical assistance.--At the request of the government \\n        of a gateway community, a Federal land agency shall assign, to \\n        the extent practicable, an agency employee or contractor to \\n        work with the community to develop data and analysis relevant \\n        to the preparation of agency plans, decisions, and policies \\n        referred to in paragraph (1).\\n            (5) Review of federal land management planning.--At the \\n        request of a gateway community, and to the extent practicable, \\n        a Federal land manager shall assist the gateway community to \\n        conduct a review of land use, management, or transportation \\n        plans of the Federal land manager likely to affect the gateway \\n        community.\\n            (6) Coordination of land use.--To the extent consistent \\n        with the laws governing the administration of the Federal \\n        public lands, a Federal land manager may enter into a \\n        cooperative agreement with a gateway community to provide for \\n        coordination between--\\n                    (A) the land use inventory, planning, and \\n                management activities for the Federal lands \\n                administered by the Federal land manager;

Today, fully 75 percent of \\n        all hospital personnel vacancies are for nurses.\\n            (2) According to the Journal of the American Medical \\n        Association (2000), the U.S. will experience a 20 percent \\n        shortage in the number of nurses needed in the U.S. health care \\n        system by the year 2020. This translates into a shortage of \\n        more than 400,000 registered nurses nationwide.\\n            (3) Research indicates that there is a greater need for \\n        health care services, especially hospitals and prescription \\n        drugs, but there continues to be a 28 percent decrease in \\n        national licensure examination for all entry-level registered \\n        nurses.\\n            (4) The U.S. Department of Labor projects a 21 percent \\n        increase in the need for nurses nationwide from 1998 to 2008, \\n        compared with a 14 percent increase for all other occupations.\\n            (5) The General Accounting Office estimates that 40 percent \\n        of all registered nurses will be older than age 50 by the year \\n        2010.\\n            (6) Of those registered nurses in 2000, an estimated 18 \\n        percent have chosen to pursue other career paths.\\n            (7) According to a 2001 issue of Health Affairs, many \\n        nurses report they are dissatisfied with their current \\n        position.
